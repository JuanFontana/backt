Backtesting librarie

The idea is to create an strategy in the functions appart, the inicialize the class, load the data, and compute the strategy with some riscmetrics.
Then, the code gives the posibility with the simulation instance to check that strategy with some arbitrary selected stocks. Anothe important accion is the "optimize" parameters with simulations.
